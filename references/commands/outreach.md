# outreach — Networking Outreach Coaching

Coach the candidate through the full outreach lifecycle: cold LinkedIn messages, warm introduction requests, informational interview asks, recruiter replies, follow-up sequences, and referral requests. Messages are built on the candidate's Positioning Statement so every outreach is differentiated, not generic.

Also read `references/differentiation.md` (for earned secret integration into message hooks) and `references/storybank-guide.md` (for story selection to build credibility in messages).

## How Outreach Actually Works

**Response Rates by Channel**: Cold email 3-5% baseline, top quartile 15-25%. LinkedIn InMail 10-25%. Connection request + personalized follow-up: 45% acceptance, 39% positive reply. Personalized messages 6x higher response. Hierarchy: warm intro > connection request + personalized follow-up > InMail with personalization > cold email with research > generic cold.

**Message Length**: Cold email 75-125 words. InMail under 400 chars = 22% higher response. Connection request: 300 char limit. Subject line: 28-39 chars.

**Platform Mechanics**: Connection request 300 chars. InMail 1900 chars. DM to connections ~8000 chars. Plain text email outperforms HTML.

**Warm Introductions**: 3-5x higher conversion. Double opt-in best practice. Forwardable email framework. Social capital dynamics.

**Informational Interviews**: 25-33% acceptance. 15-20 minute bounded asks. Never ask for a job during an informational. Same-day follow-up.

**Recruiter Interactions**: Get comp range first. Frame total comp. Respond within 24h.

**Follow-Up Cadence**: Most conversions after 1st-2nd follow-up. 3-4 max for networking. 2-3 days between early touches, 4-7 later. Multi-channel increases visibility.

**The Hidden Job Market**: Referrals = 30-50% of hires from 7% of applicants. Referred candidates 5-15x more likely hired. Referrer spends social capital.

**Common Mistakes**: Generic messages, leading with the ask, too long, no clear ask, no follow-up, weak LinkedIn profile, me-centered, premature referral request, no research.

## Priority Check

Before running the outreach coaching, check coaching state:
- If no `kickoff` has been run: Soft gate — "I can coach your outreach, but without your profile context the messages will be less targeted. Want to run `kickoff` first, or proceed?"
- If the candidate has an interview within 48 hours: Redirect — "You have an interview in [X] hours. Let's focus on `hype` / `prep` first. Outreach can wait."
- If LinkedIn Analysis is "Weak" or "Needs Work": Flag — "Your LinkedIn profile scored [Weak/Needs Work]. Recipients check your profile before responding — a weak profile undercuts even great messages. I'd recommend running `linkedin` first to fix the biggest issues, then coming back to outreach."
- If Positioning Statement exists: Use as foundation for hooks.
- If no Positioning Statement: Fall back to Resume Analysis positioning strengths, flag the gap — "You don't have a Positioning Statement yet. I'll build hooks from your resume analysis, but they'll be stronger if you run `pitch` first — it creates the consistency anchor that makes all your outreach sound like one person, not templates."

## Required Inputs

- Message type (cold LinkedIn connection request, cold LinkedIn InMail, cold email, warm intro request, informational interview ask, recruiter reply, follow-up, post-meeting follow-up, referral request, or "help me figure out the right approach")
- Target context (who they're reaching out to — person/role/company or general scenario)

## Optional Inputs

- Depth level: Quick / Standard / Deep (default: Standard)
- Candidate's draft message (for Standard critique mode)
- Specific person/company details
- Outreach goal (informational, referral, job inquiry, networking)
- Channel preference

## Depth Levels

| Level | When to Use | What It Covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Quick** | Need a template fast, exploring an approach | Message framework + annotated template + platform notes + follow-up plan |
| **Standard** | Default. Has a draft or wants coached guidance. | Critique of draft (if provided) + rewritten alternative + follow-up strategy + channel/timing. If no draft: guided construction. |
| **Deep** | High-priority target, full networking campaign | Full message drafts for specific targets + multi-channel plan + networking campaign strategy + follow-up sequences + Challenge Protocol (Level 5) |

---

## Logic / Sequence

### Step 1: Context Assembly

Pull from coaching_state.md:
- Positioning Statement (primary hook source)
- Profile (target role, seniority band)
- Resume Analysis (fallback positioning if no Positioning Statement)
- Storybank (earned secrets for hooks)
- Interview Loops (company context for targeted outreach)
- LinkedIn Analysis (profile quality gate)
- Differentiation data (from Active Coaching Strategy)

### Step 2: Situation Assessment

1. **Message type**: Which of the 9 types? If the candidate is unsure, help them decide:
   - "Do you know this person at all?" → cold vs. warm
   - "What's the goal — information, a referral, or a job?" → informational vs. referral vs. job inquiry
   - "Are they a recruiter or someone in the role?" → recruiter reply vs. networking message
2. **Relationship status**: Cold / warm-cold (shared context but no relationship) / warm (mutual connection or past interaction) / established (existing relationship).
3. **Outreach goal**: Response, meeting, referral, information, relationship building.
4. **Channel selection** (decision logic):
   - Cold + senior → LinkedIn connection request
   - Cold + recruiter → email
   - Warm intro → email (forwardable)
   - Follow-up → same channel, then add second
5. **Recipient research**: Guide candidate to find 1-2 specific things to reference — "Before we write the message, find one thing about this person that shows you did your homework. Their recent post, a talk they gave, a project they led. This is the difference between 5% and 25% response rates."

### Step 3: Message Construction (depth-dependent)

**Quick**: Framework template with annotations explaining each element, candidate-specific fill-ins, platform formatting notes (character limits, subject line guidance).

**Standard with draft**: Assess the draft against the Message Quality Rubric (Step 4), identify top 2-3 issues, provide rewrite with annotations explaining what changed and why.

**Standard without draft**: Walk through the message step-by-step, one element at a time:
1. Hook — what earns their attention?
2. Context — who are you and why them?
3. Ask — what specifically do you want?
4. Close — make it easy to say yes
Present options for each element, let the candidate choose, assemble.

**Deep**: Full drafts per target with annotations. Multi-channel plan (which channels for which targets, in what order). Networking campaign strategy:
- Phase 1: Warm contacts (existing network — who do you already know?)
- Phase 2: Warm-cold expansion (shared context — alumni, former colleagues of colleagues, industry groups)
- Phase 3: Cold outreach (researched targets — specific people at target companies)
- Phase 4: Follow-up + relationship building (cadence, value-adds, long-term nurturing)

Full follow-up sequences for each message sent.

### Step 4: Message Quality Rubric

Score each message on 5 criteria (**Strong** / **Needs Work** / **Weak**):

| Criterion | Strong | Needs Work | Weak |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Specificity** | References something specific about the recipient — a post, project, talk, or shared context | Has some specificity but it's generic ("I admire your company's mission") | Could be sent to anyone. No evidence of research. |
| **Brevity** | Within optimal length for channel. Every sentence earns its place. | Slightly over length, or has 1-2 sentences that don't add value | Way over length, or so short it lacks substance |
| **Ask Clarity** | Single, clear, appropriately-sized ask. Easy to say yes to. | Ask exists but is vague, too big, or buried | No clear ask, multiple asks, or the ask is "give me a job" |
| **Value Signal** | Clear why the recipient should care — what's in it for them? | Some value signal but it's implicit or weak | Entirely me-centered. No reason for recipient to engage. |
| **Authenticity** | Sounds like a real person wrote it. Natural voice. | Mostly natural but has template-sounding phrases | Reads like a template, AI-generated, or copied from a guide |

### Step 5: Follow-Up Strategy

For every outreach message, plan the follow-up sequence:
- **Follow-up 1** (2-5 days): Brief, adds new value. Not "just bumping this" or "circling back." Reference something new — a recent post they shared, a relevant article, a development in their space.
- **Follow-up 2** (4-7 days later): Even briefer. Try a different channel if possible. One sentence + the original ask restated simply.
- **Follow-up 3** (Deep only, recruiter context only): 7+ days. Final touch. Brief, professional, leaves the door open.
- **When to stop**: 2 follow-ups for networking. 3 for recruiter. "Silence is an answer" — don't chase past the limit. Dignity matters more than persistence.

### Step 6: Challenge Protocol (Deep, Level 5 only)

Lenses 1, 2, 4, 5 (Pre-Mortem omitted — doesn't apply to a message artifact):
- **Assumption Audit**: What must be true for this outreach to work? (e.g., "Assumes this person reads LinkedIn messages from strangers. Many senior leaders don't.")
- **Blind Spot Scan**: What can't you see about your own outreach? (e.g., "You think this message is personalized. From the recipient's perspective, the 'personalization' is their job title — that's not personal.")
- **Devil's Advocate**: If the recipient was looking for reasons to ignore this... (e.g., "No mutual connections, no specific hook, and the ask requires 30 minutes of their time. Delete.")
- **Strengthening Path**: Single highest-leverage change.

## Message Frameworks (9 types)

### 1. Cold LinkedIn Connection Request (300 chars)

```
[Shared context — mutual connection, same school, same company, same group]
[Why them — specific, not generic]
[Ask — connect, not a meeting yet]
```

**Key principles**: Lead with *them*, not you. 300 chars means every word counts. No "I'd love to pick your brain." The goal is acceptance, not a meeting — that comes after.

### 2. Cold LinkedIn InMail (1900 chars)

```
Subject: [28-39 chars — specific, not clickbait]

[Hook — why you're reaching out to THEM specifically]
[Who you are — one sentence positioning from Positioning Statement]
[Why them — what specifically about their work/role/company]
[Bounded ask — 15-20 min, specific topic, easy out]
[Close — "No worries if not" or equivalent. Make it easy to say no.]
```

**Key principles**: Subject line is 50% of the open rate. Under 400 chars = 22% higher response. Don't pitch yourself — create a reason for conversation.

### 3. Cold Email (75-125 words)

```
Subject: [28-39 chars — specific, curiosity-creating]

[Hook — one sentence that earns the next sentence]
[Who you are — positioning, not credentials]
[The ask — one clear thing, bounded]
[Close — easy out, specific next step]

[Signature — name, one-line positioning, LinkedIn URL]
```

**Key principles**: Plain text outperforms HTML. 75-125 words — every word above this threshold reduces response probability. Subject line: specific > clever.

### 4. Warm Introduction Request

Two parts — the message to your connector, and the forwardable blurb:

**To the connector**:
```
[Context — remind them of your relationship]
[The ask — "Would you be comfortable introducing me to [Name]?"]
[Why — brief reason for the introduction]
[Easy out — "Totally understand if this doesn't feel right"]
[The forwardable blurb — "Here's something you can forward directly if easier:"]
```

**Forwardable blurb** (written so the connector can forward without editing):
```
[Who you are — one sentence]
[Why them — specific connection to their work]
[The ask — bounded, clear]
[Your contact info]
```

**Key principles**: Double opt-in — ask the connector first, never go around them. Write the forwardable blurb yourself — reduce the connector's effort to zero. Acknowledge that the connector is spending social capital.

**Warm Intro Timing Guidance**: When to ask matters as much as how to ask:
- **Best timing**: After you've established or refreshed the relationship (a recent conversation, a value exchange, or existing rapport). Don't ask for an intro in your first message after years of silence — reconnect first.
- **Relationship investment rule**: The strength of the ask should be proportional to the depth of the relationship. A close former colleague can be asked directly. A loose connection needs a smaller ask first (coffee, advice) before an intro request.
- **Sequencing**: When targeting a company, check if you have a warm path before going cold. Warm intros convert 3-5x higher — it's worth spending 2-3 days warming up a connection before defaulting to cold outreach.
- **When NOT to ask**: If the connector has a complicated relationship with the target (left on bad terms, is competing for the same role), if you've already burned social capital with this connector, or if the ask is too big for the relationship depth.

### 5. Informational Interview Ask

```
[Why them — specific to their career path, role, or company]
[Who you are — brief, relevant to why you're asking them]
[What you're exploring — honest, specific]
[Bounded ask — "Would you have 15-20 minutes for a quick conversation?"]
[Easy out — "I completely understand if your schedule doesn't allow it"]
```

**Key principles**: 25-33% acceptance rate. NEVER ask for a job during an informational interview. Have 3-5 specific questions prepared. Send same-day follow-up with a thank you and one specific takeaway you're acting on.

### 6. Recruiter Reply

```
[Enthusiasm — genuine, not over-the-top]
[Positioning hook — from Positioning Statement, not credentials list]
[Comp framing — "Could you share the compensation range for this role?"]
[Availability — specific times, not "I'm flexible"]
```

**Key principles**: Respond within 24h. Get the comp range before investing time. Frame total comp (base + equity + bonus), not just salary. Don't undersell or oversell — let the positioning do the work.

### 7. Follow-Up

```
[Reference the original message — "I reached out last [day] about [topic]"]
[Add new value — a relevant article, insight, development. NOT "just following up."]
[Restate the ask — briefly, one sentence]
```

**Key principles**: Each follow-up gets shorter. Add value, don't just remind. After 2-3 follow-ups with no response, stop. Try a different channel on follow-up 2 if possible.

### 8. Post-Meeting Follow-Up

```
[Thank — specific to the conversation, not generic]
[Specific callback — reference something they said that stuck with you]
[Key takeaway — one thing you're acting on from the conversation]
[Reciprocal value — something useful for them (article, connection, resource)]
[Keep the door open — "I'd love to stay in touch as [topic] develops"]
```

**Key principles**: Same day. The specific callback shows you were listening, not just waiting to talk. Reciprocal value transforms a one-way ask into a relationship. Keep it under 150 words.

### 9. Referral Request

```
[Acknowledge the relationship — don't jump to the ask]
[Specific role — not "any openings"]
[Why you're a fit — 2-3 sentences, not your full resume]
[The ask — "Would you feel comfortable referring me?"]
[Make it easy — "I can send you my resume and a brief summary you can share"]
[Easy out — "No pressure at all if this doesn't feel right"]
```

**Key principles**: Only ask for a referral after the relationship warrants it — not after one informational interview. Be specific about the role. Provide materials so they don't have to do work. Remember: the referrer is spending social capital. If they decline, do not push.
