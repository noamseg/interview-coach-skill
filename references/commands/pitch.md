# pitch — Core Positioning Statement

Build the candidate's atomic unit of self-presentation: a positioning statement that distills who they are into a compelling, memorable core. The positioning statement is saved to coaching state and consumed by resume, linkedin, and outreach for cross-surface consistency.

Also read `references/differentiation.md` (for earned secret integration into positioning) and `references/storybank-guide.md` (for narrative identity themes and story data to anchor the statement).

## How Pitches Actually Work

**The 10-20-30 Rule**: 10 seconds to earn 20 more. 30 seconds earns the conversation. Most candidates start with credentials — but credentials don't create curiosity.

**The Curiosity Gap (Loewenstein)**: People pay attention when a gap opens between what they know and what they want to know. "I help growth-stage companies stop losing their best engineers" creates a gap. "I'm a VP of Engineering with 15 years of experience" closes it.

**Neural Coupling**: Stories synchronize brains. 63% remember stories; 5% remember statistics (Chip Heath). A pitch with a micro-story activates narrative processing. A pitch listing capabilities activates passive processing.

**Primacy Effect**: First sentence becomes the lens. 100ms to form a judgment. 33% of hiring managers decide within 90 seconds. The opening line is the pitch.

**Present-Past-Future Formula**: For "tell me about yourself" — present (what you do now), past (relevant experience), future (why this role). Not a chronological resume walkthrough.

**Hook-Context-Ask**: For networking — hook that creates curiosity, context that establishes credibility, ask that gives the listener a way to help.

**Context-Specific Durations**: Elevator 15-30s, networking 30-45s, career fair 30-60s, interview TMAY 60-90s, LinkedIn above-fold ~300 chars.

**Consistency Multiplier**: Consistent messaging across platforms = 33% more reliable to recruiters, 45% higher response rates. The positioning statement is the consistency anchor.

**What Interviewers Listen For in TMAY**: Communication clarity, narrative coherence, role relevance, self-awareness, energy. NOT a chronological resume walkthrough.

**Common Mistakes**: Too vague, too long, no differentiator, no CTA/hook, sounds rehearsed, me-centered, jargon-heavy, chronological trap.

## Priority Check

Before running the full positioning exercise, check coaching state:
- If no `kickoff` has been run: Soft gate — "I can build your positioning statement, but without your target role context I'll be working from conversation alone instead of your full profile. Want to run `kickoff` first, or proceed and we'll work with what we have?"
- If the candidate has an interview within 48 hours: Redirect — "You have an interview in [X] hours. Let's focus on `hype` / `prep` first. Come back to `pitch` after — it's a foundational exercise, not an emergency one."
- If storybank is empty but kickoff exists: Proceed with resume analysis data, note the limitation — "Your storybank is empty, so I can't anchor the positioning to earned secrets from your stories. I'll work from your resume analysis data. After this, consider running `stories` — earned secrets make the positioning much stronger."

## Required Inputs

- Target role context (from coaching_state.md Profile, or ask)
- Candidate background (from Resume Analysis + Storybank, or ask)

## Optional Inputs

- Depth level: Quick Draft / Standard / Deep Positioning (default: Standard)
- Specific context to optimize for (e.g., "networking event Thursday")
- Existing pitch attempt (for critique + rewrite)

---

## Depth Levels

| Level | When to Use | What It Covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Quick Draft** | Needs something fast, event coming up | Core statement + 2 context variants (TMAY + one requested) |
| **Standard** | Default. Full positioning exercise. | Core statement + all 5 context variants + positioning consistency check |
| **Deep Positioning** | Career transition, major repositioning, full brand foundation | All of Standard + differentiation audit + constraint ladder + Challenge Protocol (Level 5) |

---

## Logic / Sequence

### Step 1: Context Assembly

Pull from coaching_state.md:
- Profile (target role, seniority band)
- Resume Analysis (positioning strengths, career narrative gaps)
- Storybank (earned secrets from stories rated 3+, narrative identity themes)
- Active Coaching Strategy (if Differentiation is the gap, pitch addresses it directly)
- LinkedIn Analysis (current headline/about — for consistency check)
- Resume Optimization (current summary — for consistency check)
- **Positioning performance data** (if `debrief` or `analyze` have notes on how the positioning landed in real interviews): Check Interview Intelligence → Effective/Ineffective Patterns for signals about how the candidate's self-introduction landed. If TMAY or positioning-related feedback exists (e.g., "interviewer seemed engaged during intro" or "recruiter said your pitch was too vague"), use it to refine the positioning. This creates a feedback loop: pitch → interview → debrief → pitch iteration.

### Step 2: Raw Material Extraction

Guided conversation, one question at a time:
1. The differentiator question: "What do you do that other [target role] candidates at your level don't?" If storybank earned secrets exist, offer as starting points.
2. The audience question: "Who needs to hear this pitch, and what do they care about?"
3. The 'so what' question: "If someone heard your pitch and thought 'so what?' — what would make them change their mind?"

If existing pitch provided, skip to Step 3.

### Step 3: Existing Pitch Diagnostic (if existing pitch provided)

Score on 5 dimensions (1-5):
- **Hook strength**: Does the opening create curiosity?
- **Differentiation**: Could another candidate say this?
- **Specificity**: Concrete details or vague claims?
- **Audience fit**: Optimized for the intended listener?
- **Memorability**: Would they remember this an hour later?

Diagnose primary weakness, feed into rewrite.

### Step 4: Core Positioning Statement Construction

Three layers:
- **Layer 1 — The Hook** (10s): One sentence, curiosity gap. Test: would they want to hear more?
- **Layer 2 — The Context** (adds 10-20s): Evidence the hook is real. Micro-story, metric, or earned secret.
- **Layer 3 — The Bridge** (adds 10-20s): Connects to specific context (role, company, opportunity).

Present to candidate. Ask: "Does this sound like you?" Iterate. Must sound like the candidate, not the coach.

### Step 5: Context Variants (5 variants)

1. **Interview TMAY** (60-90s): Present-Past-Future. Must survive TMAY evaluation criteria: communication clarity, narrative coherence, role relevance, self-awareness, energy.
2. **Networking Event** (30-45s): Hook-Context-Ask. Ends with question, not monologue.
3. **Recruiter Call** (30-60s): Keyword-aware, signals seniority, clear "what I'm looking for."
4. **Career Fair** (30-60s): High-energy, leads with strongest credential, memorable phrase.
5. **LinkedIn Summary Hook** (~300 chars): Above-fold, keywords + curiosity gap. Written for reading, not speaking.

### Step 6: Positioning Consistency Check (Standard + Deep)

Cross-reference against:
- Resume summary (if Resume Optimization exists)
- LinkedIn headline/about (if LinkedIn Analysis exists)
- Interview narrative (if narrative identity exists)

Don't just flag gaps — provide the specific language change for each surface. Example: "Your resume summary leads with 'experienced product manager.' Your positioning hook is 'I help growth-stage teams ship 3x faster by killing the right features.' The resume summary should echo the positioning — here's a rewrite: [specific rewrite]."

### Step 7: Differentiation Audit (Deep only)

- **Is the differentiator defensible?** Evidence from storybank/resume — not just a claim.
- **Spiky enough?** Apply Spiky POV test from differentiation.md — does it make some people disagree?
- **Earned vs. borrowed?** Based on direct experience, or something learned from a podcast/book?
- **Substitution test**: Replace the candidate's name with another candidate at their level. Does the positioning still work? If yes, it's not differentiated enough.
- **Constraint ladder**: Same positioning at 15s, 30s, 60s, 90s. What stays at every level = the irreducible core.

### Step 8: Challenge Protocol (Deep, Level 5 only)

Lenses 1, 2, 4, 5 (Pre-Mortem omitted — doesn't apply to a positioning artifact):
- **Assumption Audit**: What must be true for this positioning to land? (e.g., "Assumes hiring managers in your target space care about shipping speed more than process maturity.")
- **Blind Spot Scan**: What can't the candidate see about how they present? (e.g., "You think you come across as strategic. From the outside, your pitch sounds tactical — it's about what you do, not why it matters.")
- **Devil's Advocate**: If a hiring manager heard this and was looking for reasons to pass... (e.g., "Sounds like a builder, not a leader. Where's the people dimension?")
- **Strengthening Path**: Single highest-leverage change.
